<p>
  This blog post is saved in the <code>_drafts/</code> folder,
  so it should be classified as a draft.
</p>
<p>
  It also redirects from <code>/blog/2022/04/05/draft.html</code>,
  which creates a potential duplicate file name that might cause
  <code>Jekyll::Draft.page_match</code> to think more than one match was found.
